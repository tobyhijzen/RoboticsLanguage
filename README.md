# What is the language of Robotics?

This is a very deep question with difficult answers. If robotics is meant to equal or even surpass human capabilities, then the language of robotics should be able to describe human behaviour, all the way from muscle activation to intelligence. Achieving this on a single programming language seems like an impossible task. This project proposes a new framework where multiple domain specific languages are used together to describe the behaviour of a robot. Specifically, the *Robotics Language (RoL)* is a high level robotics programming language that generates ROS c++ nodes, HTML interfaces, or other elements.

[Domain Specific Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) *are computer languages specialised to a particular application domain*. Such languages use the minimum information required to describe a particular concept for a domain, thus present an **abstraction** of information. This project uses the concept of **abstraction languages** to simplify programming by combining multiple domain specific languages in a single file.



The base RoL language has a structure similar to standard high-level programming languages

```coffeescript
# A simple topic echo node
node(
  name:'example echo',

  definitions: block(
    # the input signal
    echo_in ∈ Signals(Strings, rosTopic:'/echo/in', onNew: echo_out = echo_in ),

    # the echo signal
    echo_out ∈ Signals(Strings, rosTopic:'/echo/out')
  )
)
```

The power of the RoL is in its ability to integrate mini-abstraction languages:

```coffeescript
# A finite state machine
node(
  name:'example state machine',

  definitions: block(

    # a mini-language: code is defined within `<{ }>`
    FiniteStateMachine<{

      name:machine
      initial:idle

      (idle)-start->(running)-stop->(idle)
      (running)-error->(fault)-reset->(idle)
      (idle)-calibration->(calibrate)-reset->(idle)

    }>,

    # the start signal
    start ∈ Signals(Empty, rosTopic:'/start', onNew: machine.fire('start')),

    # the stop signal
    stop ∈ Signals(Empty, rosTopic:'/stop', onNew: machine.fire('stop'))

  )
)
```
Automatically generated graphical user interfaces in the browser allow for development and monitoring.

RoL contains high-level language element abstractions that are very useful for robotics, such as Interval [Temporal Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic) for signals.


```coffeescript
node(
  name:'temporal logic test example',

  definitions: block(

    # a signal
    x ∈ Signals(Booleans, rosTopic:'/temporal_logic/x'),

    when(□[1,0](x),
      print('always in the last second')),

    when(◇[4,1](x),
      print('eventually from 4 seconds to 1 second ago')),

    when(□[5,0](◇[1,0](x) ∧ ◇[1,0](¬x)),
      print('oscillating faster then 1Hz for at least 5 seconds'))

  )
)
```

Generated GUIs visualise the signals in time and the outcome of the logic.

The RoL is in practice an **open compiler** where users can develop their own languages by means of plug-ins. The RoL is programmed in python and uses XML as the internal abstract syntax tree.

## Install

The best way to install is using `pip` or `pip2` if you have python 3 installed:

```shell
pip install RoboticsLanguage
```

To install this version in github, first `git clone`:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/robotcaresystems/RoboticsLanguage.git
```

Next, if you are a user run:
```shell
pip install .
```

If you are a developer run:
```shell
pip install -e .
```


## Examples
You can try the RoL compiler by testing the examples in the folder `RoboticsLanguage/Examples`:

```shell
rol RoboticsLanguage/Examples/1_hello_world.rol
```

This will create a ROS node in the folder `~/deploy`. If you have installed the catkin workspace at `~/catkin_ws` then you can supply the path to the compiler and compile and launch the node directly:

```shell
rol --deploy-path ~/catkin_ws/src/ RoboticsLanguage/Examples/1_hello_world.rol -c -l
```

**Note:** if you don't have a catkin workspace make sure to run:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin init
```

After compiling the rol package for the first time make sure to source it:

```shell
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```


## Docker image

You can test the robotics language using a docker environment. It comes completely preinstalled with the latest version of the Robotics Language.

get the docker:
```shell
docker pull roboticslanguage/rol
```

Create a folder to share files between docker and your system:
```shell
mkdir -p ~/RoL/docker_catkin_ws
```

Add easy launch commands by copying the lines below into your `~/.bashrc`:
```shell
# where is your base RoL folder
export ROL_PATH=$HOME/RoL/

# alias to run robotics language docker
alias rol_docker='xhost +local:docker; \
  docker run -it --rm \
  --name="rol_docker" \
  --env=DISPLAY \
  --env=XDG_RUNTIME_DIR \
  --env=QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 \
  --device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  -v "${ROL_PATH:?}/docker_catkin_ws:/home/roboticslanguage/catkin_ws/" \
  --workdir /home/roboticslanguage/examples \
  --net=host \
  --add-host rol_docker:127.0.0.1 \
  --hostname=rol_docker \
  roboticslanguage/rol'
# alias to attach to an existing rol_docker
alias rol_docker_attach='docker exec -it -e "COLUMNS=$COLUMNS" -e "LINES=$LINES" rol_docker bash'
```

Next start the docker image

```shell
source ~/.bashrc
rol_docker
```

You can open another shell by running `rol_docker_attach`.

For the first time, setup the user rights in the shared folder:
```shell
sudo chown $(whoami):$(whoami) ~/catkin_ws
```

Once in the docker, everything is configured. You can compile the example:

```shell
rol 1_hello_world.rol -c
```

Make sure to source for the first time:

```shell
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

Now you are ready to launch:

```shell
rol RoboticsLanguage/Examples/1_hello_world.rol -l
```

## Work in progress
